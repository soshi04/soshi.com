                <p>I'm a senior Computer Science student at Georgia Tech with a passion for building intuitive,
                full-stack applications that blend functionality and thoughtful design. 
                My recent projects include a leetcode problem suggestion tool and a personal productivity assistant powered
                by OpenAI, reflecting my focus on using machine learning and web technologies to solve problems.
                Iâ€™ve explored deep learning, React, TypeScript, Express, GraphQL, and cloud platforms like Vercel and Google Cloud,
                and I enjoy learning new tools by applying them to hands-on projects. I also have experience fine-tuning LLMs for scientific 
                applications and a growing interest in the intersection of AI and human cognition. Outside of coding, I enjoy climbing,
                playing soccer, and reading.
