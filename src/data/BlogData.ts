  ### June Project

  As I said last month, I wanted to focus on Computer Vision and so for this project I decided to try something simple. I knew about YOLO framework for CV and I decided to mess around with that to create a finger count detection
  model. The goal would simply be to detect a hand and then also display how many fingers were being held up. At first I thought I could use a pre labeled kaggle dataset but then I realized I needed to detect the hand as well at classify it
  for my project which would be using a live video feed. At the time of writing this I now know that there are so many better models and frameworks (like mediapipe by google) that already do all this but I didn't do enough research before starting so I
  decided to create my entire dataset from scratch. This entire process of data engineering actually taught me so much so I'm glad I did it in the end. All the code is on my github linked on the project so you can follow along and in this post I'll just 
  walk through the general process. To begin I first made a really simple script to capture several pictures of my hand while I was holding up various finger counts. After I had my data I had to annotate all of it so I could have the YOLO model detect hands
  and attach the respective classification box. To do this I used RoboFlow to go through the +2000 images and create annotations. As the reader can assume, this process was pretty tedious. I also had to repeat it multiple times as to imporve model preformance 
  its always a good idea to just get more data. If this project taught me anything at all it was the importance of good quality data to train a model. When I first trained and tested my intial model, it preformed extremly poorly in real world application. I realized that
  the model was not generalizing well to different backgrounds with changes in lighting and different peoples hands. After gathering more data I found out about adding augmentations to the images. Roboflow makes this process extremely simple and I added around 4-5 thousand more images to the
  dataset. I also eventually purchased Google Colab Pro because then I could have access to the GPU and train a larger model with more parameters. I settled on a YOLOv8m but I couldve trained a larger model. The larger model probably would've ran terribly on my MacBook so its fine
  that I didnt. At the end, the model actually preformed really well in real world application but it took in 800x800 images and it was just too much to run smoothly on my local device. Since I didnt want to pay to host it anywhere I could not deploy it which is a bit unfortunate. I did host my
  dataset as well as the model on HuggingFace to try for anyone who is curious as well as having a super simple and easy to follow notebook on my github.

        description: 'My thoughts about this classic book by Ernest Hemmingway',
        content: ` This was a quick read before me and my friend start reading Crime and Punishment (a book that has been on my bookself for a while). I had never read Hemmingway before
        but this book was extremely short and we decided to split it up in to a quick 3 day read. I personally thought the beginning of the book was a little slow but after he hooks the marlin
        the rest of the story was sensational. There is so much to analyize in this book but one theme that really stuck out to me was Santiago's pride. He had been on a long streak of bad luck
        and this fish was more than just a fish to him. It was a battle to prove to himself that he was still a great fisherman. This ego to prove something leads to an intense battle. Throughout this
        battle with the fish, there are several times when you can't help but think "just left it go" as he brushes with death several times all because he is too prideful to let this fish go. Santiago's fight with the marlin
        becomes a metaphor for the human condition, noble, painful, and deeply personal. Despite losing the fish to sharks, Santiago's endurance and courage highlight Hemingway's idea of the a hero as someone who shows perseveres under pressure.
        The plot was pretty straightforward but its rich symbolism and emotion emphasizes the greater message that success isnâ€™t always measured by outcomes, but by how one faces adversity. I also thought the ending was well done as well although
        it was kind of impossible to mess up the ending after a certain point in the story. Even if he died or not, brought back the fish or not, all outcomes would've worked perfectly with the themes of the story. Even though Santiago felt as if he
        lost at the end of the story, the reader as well as the other characters in the story know of his success and that again highlights a crucial point, success is only measured by the individual.

### Portfolio Website

Having really nothing to do for the summer I decided it would be the perfect time to create something new to showcase myself.
The obvious first step was to learn react so I could build a personal website to showcase my past and current projects as well as a place to write about the summer (aka this blog).
Learning React and Typescript in general was not too difficult honestly and having AI to explain problems definately made things a lot easier. I learned about structuring fullstack projects
and while this website is all front-end (at least at the time of me writing this) I would also go on to learn basic backend development since I would need a database for my first project. I wasn't really sure
on where to begin learning React + Typescript but like everything new in tech, I knew the simpliest way was to just read about it. I went to the [React docs](https://react.dev/learn) and literally just went through it. Everything
I read I implimented on a simple project (which you can probably view on my Github if its public under 'first-proj') and that was how I began working on this very website. I knew from the beginnning that
I wanted to focus this summer on ML projects, specifically projects in NLP and computer vision since those feilds are the most interesting to me. So learning all website stuff was just a stepping stone. I just 
needed to learn how to make this so I could put stuff out on here. At first (and even now) styling everything is actually so tedious because I dont care enough to actually learn it but all the other React stuff
was pretty interesting. I picked up on making components and pages pretty quick as well as local routing. For me the most fun part of react was probably figuring out passing props between components and using hooks
from both React and MUI. With hooks in particular, for some reason it took me so long to figure out how to make the lightmode/darkmode part of this site and then also passing the state of the site to the words so that
the white text words wouldnt disappear when the mode was set to light. I deployed the site with vercel since you can have like 200 projects on there. Doing the styling with CSS files was terrible and soon I started using Material-UI and it was life changing. The styling was so much nicer with all the 
components already there and the custimizations that I wanted to do was simple enough to figure out. I would highly reccomend using MUI for styling, I haven't even used it that much and there is so much more I want to get around to doing with it.

---
### First Project
Funny I say that I want to do more with styling but this project has literally zero styling (at least when I'm writing this). After getting the projects tab working on the website it was time to actually put something up on there. I had been doing a decent bit of leetcode
recently because I got cooked by leetcode questions for an ML role interview :/ so fair enough. Even though leetcode is basically useless now since you can just get the interview cheat things or whatever I had been doing it just to boost general problem solving and coding skills.
It became pretty fun and so I decided to make a super simple GPT wrapper type of project on leetcode to get experience making one even though its like the most meme'd on type of project you could possibly do. The first challenge with this project was figuring out how to use the Leetcode
API to get the stats of a user profile. I dont know how much the reader will care about this but Leetcode's API is in GraphQL and there was also no public documentation so to figure out how to make requests I had to find the query's myself and keep testing which was interesting. After getting
the users data from Leetcode the goal was to send that data to a prompt-trained gpt4.0 and get reccomendations on what to focus on next based on what the user has already done, tell the user why they should focus on the new skill, and resources so they could get started learning the new skill.
This was simple enough and I set-up the "backend" for API calls to OpenAI and Leetcode. I could host all of these on vercel functions too which was really nice. Everything was working fine but that was before I realized that each time someone used my site it would charge me and when my friends 'tested' it
they just spammed it so that wasn't good. I decided to set up a sign in system so I could track users and limit them to only 3 lookups a day so I wouldn't be financally ruined by my friends. Setting up the login was honestly not that bad through Firebase because you can just set up the authentication on the console and
then the coding part was chill. Firebase also allows you to have a database with your project so I could store the amount of times a certain user would call lookups. There were some difficulties I had with setting up Firebase and I did kind of rush through it so in later projects thats definitely something I want to work
more with.

### May
While I did get some stuff done this month, it was mostly foundational. In these coming months I want to learn a lot more about NLP and Computer Vision to the point where I can actually create and deploy projects that I find interesting and am actually passionate about, not just stepping stones.
This was my final month of living in my hometown Rochester, MN. My family is moving soon to Atlanta so that is pretty time consuming for me right now. Also, literally right at the start of May, I dislocated my shoulder while doing indoor climbing so thats also been super annoying. I've been pretty into climbing this year and now I wont be able to climb basically all summer.
On the bright side, this month I spent time with my family and hometown friends a good bit as well since I do not know when I will go back to see them (hopefuly winter break or something) and that was nice. We are going to leave June 6th and drive to Atlanta so thats all for now.
